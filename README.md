# Authenticating-various-operations-using-face-recognition
Hey there !  
Python OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human and that's the property we have used for the authentication of several operation by just one face detection. 
Using face detection we have done following operations:- 
          (1). Sending WhatsApp message and a image attaching with e-mail       
          (2). Launching infrastructure by terraform       
          (3). Launching AWS EC2 and EBS Volume
